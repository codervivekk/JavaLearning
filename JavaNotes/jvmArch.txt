Java Architecture Basics:
		1.We code and save Java Program with .java extension.
		2.We compile the source file with the help of javac compiler.
			->javac Program.java
				->Program.class files generated.
			->It generates ByteCode file with .class extension.
		3.We run the Bytecode file with the help of JVM.
			->java Program
				* Process involved while we run this command:
					->jvm occupies some part of RAM for processing the bytecode file.
					->classLoader loads the bytecode file into the jvm.
						->It checks whether the existing .class file exists or not.
							->Throws exception if file not exists.
					->Bytecode Verifier verifies whether:
						->anything is missing in the bytecode,
						->any malicious code is there in the bytecode
							->Throws exception if any of the above exists.
					->Interpreter helps us to execute the entire code line by line.
						*3 components involved in execution of the byteCode.
							->Interpreter
							->JIT Compiler
							->Security Manager
					->After Interpretation, JVM converts the bytecode into ML code
					->JVM gives each line of ML code to the OS.
					->OS displays it on the o/p screen.
